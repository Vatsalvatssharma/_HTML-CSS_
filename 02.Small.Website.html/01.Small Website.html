    <p>Physics Wallah Private Limited (commonly known as Physics Wallah; or simply PW) is an Indian multinational educational technology company headquartered in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. The company was founded by Alakh Pandey in 2016 as a YouTube channel aimed at teaching the physics curriculum for the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE). In 2020, Pandey, along with his cofounder Prateek Maheshwari created the Physics Wallah app, which allowed students to access courses related to the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). In June 2022, after raising $100 million during its initial funding round, the company reached a valuation of $1.1 billion, becoming a unicorn company.

        In March 2023, several teachers employed by the company alleged that the company had lost sight of its vision and started their own rival company called "Sankalp Bharat". Later the same year, a teacher employed by the company alleged that rival company Adda247 had tried to poach teachers away from Physics Wallah. Sankalp Bharat was later revealed to be a venture of Adda247.
